# PythonRPC

1.   Copy Veristand_manualconnection.py to Mac [#Machinne 1] (I was running this on another Windows Machine in my case)
2.   Copy rpyc_MyService.py to Windows connected to RT machine [#Machine 2]
3.   This third step is an artifact of how Veristand examples are written. For your actual application, you wonâ€™t need this. Copy Veristand Engine Basic Demo Python examples to the folder where rpyc_MyService.py runs on your Windows machine connected to RT. The examples folder would contain legacy_mix.py, basic_example.py files and engine_demo folder
3.	Open Veristand on #Machine 1, deploy system definition file
4.	Run rpyc_MyService.py
5.	Finally, run Veristand_manual.py
6.	At this point, you should read RPM from remote machine
